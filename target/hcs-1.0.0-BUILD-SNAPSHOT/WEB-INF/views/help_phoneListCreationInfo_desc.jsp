<p class="help_paragraph">The Internal Dialing number should be the number of the phone when dialed locally, i.e. from another phone in the same call server. In most cases, the internal dialing is set to 4 digit dialing. If that is the case, then the phone extension or 4 digits used for dialing should be entered in Internal Dialing.</p>

<p class="help_paragraph">The External Dialing number should be the number of the phone when dialed from an external call server. Normally, this is a 10 digit dialing. If a ‘9’ and ‘1’ is needed for external dialing add them to the phone DN.</p>
