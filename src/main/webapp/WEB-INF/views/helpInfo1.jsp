			Today’s UCaaS (Unified Communications as a Service) players are offering over the top (OTT) services where the quality of voice can have a significant impact based on the quality of the network. It also is harder to manager the phones remotely to diagnose and debug the problems. This solution should help solve the problem.
			<br></br>
			onPOINT™ is a cloud based application that offers end point monitoring and assurance management. The solution will offer the service provider the ability to monitor and manage their end points and ensure that trouble sites and devices are easily identified for quick and efficient issue resolution.

			As demonstrated in the picture, the onPOINT solution is the central management component, which will allow the development, scheduling execution and reporting of the phones status. The phones are residing in the client sites. onPOINT will have to discover the phones by talking to the provisioning platform and be able to connect with the phones automatically. Once the phones are contacted, onPOINT will track the phones based on the data the phones are providing and making live calls from the phones to other phones within the customer site or making phones to a phone in the provider’s data center.  
			The two main objectives of this application are, to verify the phones can make and receive calls and to collect statistics the phones are reporting and present them to make diagnosis and debugging when required.
