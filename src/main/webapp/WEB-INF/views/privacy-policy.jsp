tekVizion PVS Inc., d/b/a tekVizion ("tekVizion") is committed to protecting your privacy and developing technology that gives you the most powerful and safe online experience. This Privacy Policy applies to the tekVizion website and governs data collection and usage. By using the Cloud Application, you consent to the data practices described in this policy.

We will collect personal data that you submit or which we collect through your use of the website. We may disclose this personal data to tekVizion's licensors, affiliates or participating vendors. We will keep you informed by electronic means about events, products and services that we believe may be of interest to you as a user of the tekVizion Cloud Application. We may transfer your personal data to countries or jurisdictions which do not provide the same level of data protection as the country in which your personal data was originally collected. If we do make such a transfer, we will take reasonable steps to protect your personal data. We also use cookies to allow us to provide our services and products. If you continue to use our website, then we will assume that you consent to our use of your personal data in this manner. 

If you have questions or concerns about our privacy policy or practices, please contact us in the first instance at <a href="mailto:legal@tekvizion.com">legal@tekvizion.com</a>. 	 
 
The tekVizion's onPOINT cloud-based application located at <a target="_blank" href="https://onpoint.tekvizion.com">https://onpoint.tekvizion.com</a>.(hereinafter the "Cloud Application") is owned and operated by tekVizion PVS Inc. ("tekVizion," "we," or "us"). The Cloud Application provides a comprehensive offering of IP phone automation in a virtual Cloud Application for your performance testing and development purposes (the "Services").
  
This Privacy Policy is part of the Terms of Use, which constitutes a binding agreement between you and tekVizion. Please read carefully through all sections of this Privacy Policy. Your access to and use of the Cloud Application is subject to this Privacy Policy and all applicable laws. By registering with, creating an account, accessing and/or otherwise using the Cloud Application, you consent to tekVizion's use of the non-personal and personal data as set forth below in this Privacy Policy on behalf of you and your company (collectively, "you"). If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, then you may not use the Cloud Application and you should not register with or submit your contact information to the Cloud Application. This Privacy Policy may be changed by us from time to time without notice to you, and the governing version will be posted on the Cloud Application. Please review this Privacy Policy on a regular basis as your use of the Cloud Application will be governed by the then-current Privacy Policy.

tekVizion recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of our customers and the users of the Cloud Application. However, some uses of such information are required for us to conduct legitimate business by providing information of interest about our customers and the users of the Cloud Application.  

<span class="contentHeading">Notice to California Residents</span>
Except as expressly identified below, we do not disclose a user's personal information to any third party for its direct marketing purposes. Thus, under California Civil Code Sections 1798.80-1798.84, Owner has no obligation to a California resident to provide further information regarding Owner's use of the California resident's personal data. Any inquiries regarding the Terms of Use or, specifically, this Privacy Policy can be directed to the contact identified below.

<span class="contentHeading">Notice to Utah Residents</span>
Except as expressly identified below, we do not disclose a user's personal data to any third party. 

<span class="contentHeading">What this Privacy Policy Covers</span>
This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of non-personally identifiable and personally identifiable information that we collect when you are on the Cloud Application and when you use Services provided on the Cloud Application. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own and/or control or to people that we do not employ or manage.

<span class="contentHeading">Information Collected</span>
<span class="content_underline">IP Address</span>.We may log all connections to our web servers. Those log files will include your IP address. An IP address is NOT personally identifiable information, but general information about your location, connection to the Internet, and your Internet Service Provider. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer the Cloud Application. Additionally, we will use your IP address to track your navigation of the Cloud Application and any internal website searches.  

<span class="content_underline">Cookies</span>. "Cookies" are small pieces of information stored in User's browser that give the User a unique identification. The Cloud Application uses only Cookies that (1) create a user session ID, (2) count the visits by one user, (3) recognize and collect user login information, and (4) log user UNIX computer time. For more information about cookies, please visit <a target="_blank" href="http://www.AboutCookies.org">www.AboutCookies.org</a>.

<span class="content_underline">Clear Gifs</span>. We may also employ a software technology called clear gifs (also known as web beacons) that help us better manage content on the Cloud Application by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of users. Clear gifs and cookies are not tied to the user's personally identifiable information.

<span class="content_underline">Personal Data</span>. We may collect personal data from our users when providing certain Services. We recognize two kinds of personal data that deserve different levels of protection:
<ul>
<li>Personally identifiable information includes, for example, your name, company name, address, e-mail address, and phone number.
<li>Payment/Financial Information includes bank account and/or credit card information combined with your name or account number. Our third-party payment processor will store your Payment/Financial Information and their use of your information is governed by their privacy policy, viewable at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.authorize.net/company/privacy/">http://www.authorize.net/company/privacy/</a>.
</ul>
tekVizion collects personally identifiable information only when there is a legitimate need to do so. If your relationship with us includes providing us with sensitive data, we will endeavor to protect that information using commercially reasonable measures. Except as provided herein, we will not distribute sensitive data outside of tekVizion and our affiliates.

<span class="contentHeading">Information Use</span>
<span class="content_underline">How Your Non-Personally Identifiable Information May Be Used. </span>
<ul>

<li>To develop new services and ideas; and

<li>Your payment information will be used on a monthly or quarterly basis to charge the monthly subscription fee on the provided account.
</ul>
We will give you the opportunity to "opt out" of receiving any unsolicited information from us or to limit the unsolicited information you receive from us to information regarding the Services or information you specifically request or information we determine you may find useful as a result of your use of the Cloud Application.  

<span class="contentHeading">Information Sharing and Disclosure</span>
We will not share your personally identifiable information with any other person or company without obtaining your prior express consent. However, we will share personally identifiable information about you to other companies or people when:
<ul>
<li>We need to share your information to provide the service you have requested;
<li>We need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of tekVizion to provide a service to you (unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us);
<li>We find that your actions on our websites violate the Terms and Conditions of Use, any of our usage guidelines for specific services or any agreement; and
<li>As required to respond to or initiate subpoenas, court orders, or legal process.
</ul>
In the event you voluntarily share personal or sensitive information in any public forum in the Cloud Application, such as a message board or in a chat room, please be advised that such information may be collected and used by the other users of the Cloud Application who have access to such message boards and chat rooms. tekVizion shall have no liability resulting from the misuse of information you voluntarily share during your use of the Cloud Application. 

tekVizion shall have no obligation to police the message boards and chat rooms, but has the ability to remove such information in its sole discretion.

We may sell or buy other businesses or entities. In such event, we may transfer or assign the information we have collected as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In such transactions, your personally identifiable information may be included in the transferred business assets.

<span class="contentHeading">Ability to Review and Edit Your Information</span>
You may review and approve the information about you that was stored in our database and obtained through your use of or registration on the Cloud Application. Upon your written request, we will remove that information from our database or change or correct personal data that you state is erroneous within applicable regulatory or other legal requirements. You should understand, however, that information about you in our database might come from a number of sources.

<span class="contentHeading">Security</span>
We will maintain reasonable safeguards to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of your personally identifiable information. However, no electronic storage method or data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

<span class="contentHeading">Change of Control</span>
We may sell or buy other businesses or entities. In such event, we may transfer or assign the information we have collected as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In such transactions, your personal information may be included in the transferred business assets.

<span class="contentHeading">Changes to this Privacy Policy</span>
We reserve the right to change, modify or otherwise update this policy at any time. These changes or updates will be effective immediately. We may provide you notice of such changes when they are material, such notice may be given by posting on this Cloud Application, by electronic or conventional mail or by any other means by which you obtain notice of the changes or updates.
